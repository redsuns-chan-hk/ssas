# Self-Service Appointment System
This project is the improved version of my final year project in IVE.
I cannot publish the source of existing FYP code due to license problem. Therefore, I'm creating this project to re-develop the system with my latest coding skills.
The system was aimed to provide a web application for the HKers to enjoy the free workstation borrow service of HK public library.

## Structure
There are total three front-end in the system (Based on the exists IVE fyp):

1) Web application
	- For HKers, or the people who have a HKID card
	- Developed for learning to update data in async way
2) Admin Panel
	- For HK public library's officer (ACO / TO)
	- Developed for learning how to display the data
3) Appointment management panel for Computer Technician
	- Developed for learning how to create a complicated component with Angular

## Technique
The technique being used in this project:

1) Node.js
	- As the backend server of the system
2) Angular
	- As the front end framework of three applications
3) Mongo DB
	- As the database of the system

## What I've learnt from this project
1) Design a clean API for mutliple platform
2) Design a set of collections(tables) in non-relation database(Mongo DB)
3) Develop a big-scale Angular application
4) Develop a token system with JWT authentication
5) Combine latest mobile technology with traditional web application (QR Code)
